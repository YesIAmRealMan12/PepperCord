# PepperCord
PepperCord was born out of necessity for a simpler alternative to bots like MEE6, Dyno, and Purity.
It is a "Whatever goes" bot. Has a ton of worthless garbage commands, and some cool things.
* On the front of utility, it has everything you need and nothing more. 
	* Reaction roles? Check.
	* Join/Leave messages? Check.
	* Moderation? Check.
    * Time Punishments? Check.
	* Privileges? Check.
* On the front of fun commands, it has all you need to keep the conversation going.
	* Image editing & creation
	* Web queries
	* ASCII art
	* Games

On top of all of that, it is completely open-source and is accepting pull requests at all times.

## Config
To setup the bot, run it so it copies the `config.example.yml` file into the `config` dir. Follow the instructions and populate fields in that file.
